This is a simple Spark-based movie recommender system. I wrote it for a 
talk at Target Analytics Network on January 26, 2016.

Because it's just a one-off demo, there are some messy parts, especially with
hardcoded constants all over the place. 

You'll need to add the following files:

 * Spark (tested version 1.4.1)
 * mongodb-driver-3.2.1.jar
 * mongodb-driver-core-3.2.1.jar
 * mongo-hadoop-core-1.4.0.jar
 * Recent snapshot of the Movielens database in ./data/

Also, you'll need
 * MongoDB running on localhost:27017
 * MeteorJS, with MONGO_URL set to localhost:27017
 * Pandas
 * Pymongo

To run:
 * Run loader.py. This should only need to happen once. 
 * In webui, run "meteor run"
 * Rate some movies in your web browser (port 3000 by default)
 * pyspark processor.spark.py
 * Your movie recommendations will appear!

You might want to adjust:
 * The threshold for ratings that get saved to the database, in processor.spark.py. 
 * We only load ratings for the top 1000 most-rated movies, to avoid really obscure stuff. You can adjust that in loader.py.
 * The number of ratings loaded before training, in loader.py.
